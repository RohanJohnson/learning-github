# Differences-between-remote-and-local-repo

A remote Git repository is a version of your project that is hosted on the internet or network, while a local Git repository is a version of your project that is stored on your local machine. 

A local repository allows you to work on your project locally, making changes and committing them to the repository. A remote repository, on the other hand, allows you to share your project with others, and collaborate on the project with others. 

You can push your local changes to the remote repository, and pull changes made by others from the remote repository to your local machine. 


# Summary

A local repository is a version of your project that only you have access to, while a remote repository is a shared version of your project that can be accessed and worked on by multiple people.
